# Prime-Login-Page-CSS

This is my first CSS project using CSS and HTML.Firstly i learned the basics of css and html and started working on this project.

Weâ€™ll start with the HTML, as it is the one responsible for the information displayed in the page. In other words, first we will write and structure all the information contained in the page without worrying for style (CSS).
To modify each element in our HTML file, we can select them using ids, classes or the tag names themselves, though the last option is discouraged. You see, the styles of more specific CSS selectors overwrite the styles of less specific ones.


Feedback is welcomed.
